Hey guys, if there has been anything I've taken away from working with my friend Alex to improve my developing skills and to actually become a developer is to not give up. Why? When I started I couldn't even tell you what a class was, now I can tell you with confidence it is a type of method. If I gave up I would of never made my first project, my website, or felt I was actually cut out for this.


With the right amount of patience I feel anyone can become a developer, there are so many online resources, communities, and people who are always willing to help people with the drive to want to learn. In all honesty I feel this applies to anything anyone wants to do in life, if you don't give up eventually you have to succeed, or at least die trying. 


To finish this up, I honestly feel the only way a person can really fail is if they give up. When you give up on something you want then you failed, no matter how you look at it. Though it may just be my opinion, that opinion is what got me here today.
