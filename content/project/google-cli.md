## [google-cli] (https://github.com/DavidKroncke/google-cli)

google-cli was the first project I ever completed. It is a command line interface for google searches. I decided to make it for faster searches while coding.

This is how it is used:

```
$ google What is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything\?
```
