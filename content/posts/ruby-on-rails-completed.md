I finally finished the tutorial I was following for [Ruby on Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). I really had a lot of fun following along and learned a lot along the way. Stuff like how important attention to detail really is in development, asking questions isn't ever frowned upon, and how good it felt to release it. Releasing my first web application is actually really exciting and I can't wait to deploy it. 

I feel extremely accomplished with all of this, and I can honestly see how far I've come in such a quick time. I can't wait to keep learning and improving.
