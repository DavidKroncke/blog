Unfortunately today I got sent home early from work, but the plus side is I got play around with Ruby on Rails today! I was honestly surprised by how easy it was to follow along and understand the tutorial I used for [RoR](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). I definitely see a huge use to RoR for new developers as my self for not only organization but speed efficacy as well.

I didn't finish ruby rails tonight, I have a job interview tomorrow at 10:30 am and 1pm, I'm getting excited with all the things going on in my life right now!
