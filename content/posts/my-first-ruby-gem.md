So today someone came to me on [ruby on rails link](https://rubyonrails-link.slack.com) slack and told me I should try to turn [google-cli] (https://github.com/DavidKroncke/google-cli) 
into a Ruby Gem. He told me to start with a [tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/creating-your-first-gem/), during this tutorial I learned that Ruby Gem was already on my computer. Though with a few tries I finally got it!

So all in all, my main take away for this was realizing how far along I've come, but it's made me realize I don't think I'm quite ready to make my own exectuable gem. At some point in the future I do plan on adding more to google-cli and making it an exectuable gem. I also got the experince of creating my first gem, and learning what a Ruby Gem is. (Ps: It's the barebone of all Ruby Apps)
